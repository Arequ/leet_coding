# Missing Number

"""
Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n] return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.
Follow up: Could you implement a solution using only o(1) extra space complexity and O(n) runtime complexity?
"""


# O(1) will need some binary properties
# XOR operator is required or "exclusive-or" operator.
# Lets say we wanna 2 ^ 3 (^ is the symbol for XOR)
# bit reps of each     1 0
#                      1 1
# If they're different:  1
# Otherwise we get:      0

# Example:
# input: [3, 0, 1]
# range = len(input)
# range = [0, 3]
# now we can 
# [3,0,1] ^ [0,1,2,3]


# Another way, what is took the sum of the range
sum(range())
